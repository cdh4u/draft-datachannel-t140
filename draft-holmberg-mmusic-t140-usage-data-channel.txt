1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T Protocol for multimedia application text conversation
   (Recommendation ITU-T T.140) [T140] defines a protocol for text
   conversation, also known as realtime text or text telephony.  The
   native transport for IP networks is based on the Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC4103].

   This document specifies how a WebRTC data channel
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] can be used as a transport mechanism
   for T.140, and how the SDP offer/answer mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] can be used to negotiate such
   data channel.

   In this document, a T.140 data channel refers to a WebRTC data
   channel for which the instantiated sub-protocol is "t140", and where
   the channel is negotiated using the SDP-based external negotiation
   method [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   NOTE - This WebRTC term of a "T.140 data channel" is actually synonym
   to the originally introduced concept of a "T.140 data channel"] for
   the T.140 protocol back in 1998, see Section 4.3 of [T140].

   NOTE - The decision to transport realtime text over a data channel,
   instead of using RTP based transport [RFC4103], in WebRTC is
   constituted by use-case "U-C 5: Realtime text chat during an audio

   and/or video call with an individual or with multiple people in a
   conference", see Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   The brief notation "T.140" is used as a synonym for the text
   conversation protocol according to [T140].

   This document is based on an earlier Internet draft edited by Keith
   Drage, Juergen Stoetzer-Bradler and Albrecht Schwarz.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SDP Considerations

   The generic SDP considerations, including the SDP Offer/Answer
   proceudres, for negotiating a WebRTC data channel are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].  This section defines the SDP
   considerations that are specific to a T.140 data channel.

3.1.  Use of dcmap Attribute

   An offerer and answerer MUST, in each offer and answer, include an
   SDP 'dcmap' attribute [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] in the
   SDP media descripton (m= line) [RFC4566] describing the SCTP
   association [RFC4960] used to realize the T.140 data channel.

   The offerer and answerer MUST include the following attribute
   parameters, and parameter values in the dcmap attribute:

   o  "label=" labelstring
   o  "subprotocol=" "t140"

   The offerer and answerer MUST NOT include the max-retr, max-time and
   ordered attribute parameters in the dcmap attribute.

   The offerer and answerer MAY, based on local policy, include the
   priority attribute parameter in the dcmap attribute value.

   Below is an example of the dcmap attribute for an T.140 data channel
   with stream=3 and without any label:

   a=dcmap:3 subprotocol="t140"

3.2.  Use of dcsa Attribute

   An offerer and answerer MAY, in each offer and answer, include an SDP
   'dcsa' attribute [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg] in the SDP
   media descripton (m= line) describing the SCTP association used to
   realize the T.140 data channel.

   If included, the 'dcsa' attribute contains the fmtp attribute used to
   indicate a maximum character transmission rate [RFC4103].  The 'cps'
   attribute parameter is used indicate the maximum character
   transmission rate that the endpoint that includes the attribute is
   able to handle.  The 'format' attribute parameter is not used with
   T.140 data channels, and MUST be set to "-".

   If not included, it indicates that no maximum character transmission
   rate is indicated.  It does not mean that the default value of 30
   applies [RFC4103].

   The offerer and answerer MAY modify the 'cpc' attribute parameter
   value in subsequent offers and answers.

   NOTE: The 'cps' attribute parameter is especially useful when a T.140
   data channel endpoint is acting as a gateway Section 5 and is
   interworking with a T.140 transport mechanism that have restrictions
   on how many characters can be sent per second.

   Below is an example of the dcsa attribute for an T.140 data channel
   with a 'cps' attribute parameter with a attribute parameter value of
   20:

   a=dcsa:1 fmtp:- cps=20

3.3.  Example

   Below is an example of an SDP media description (m= line) describing
   an SCTP association used to realize a T.140 data channel.


       m=application 911 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel
       c=IN IP6 2001:db8::3
       a=max-message-size:1000
       a=sctp-port 5000
       a=dcmap:1 label="text conversation";subprotocol="t140"
       a=dcsa:1 fmtp:- cps=20

4.  T.140 Considerations

4.1.  Session Layer Functions

   Section 6.1 of [T140] describes the generic T.140 session control
   functions at high-level and a signalling protocol independent manner.
   The list below describes how the functions are realized when using a
   T.140 data channel.

   o  Prepare session: An endpoint can indicate its support of T.140
      data channels using signalling specific means, or by indicating
      the support in an offer or answer Section 3
   o  Initiate session: An offer used to request the establishment of a
      T.140 data channel Section 3
   o  Accept session: An answer used to accept a request to establish a
      T.140 data channel Section 3
   o  Deny session: An answer used to reject a request the establishment
      of a T.140 data channel, using the generic procedures for
      rejecting a data channel [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]
   o  Disconnect session: An offer or answer used to disable a
      previously established T.140 data channel, using the generic
      procedures for closing a data channel
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]
   o  Data: Data sent on an established T.140 data channel Section 4.2

4.2.  Data Encoding and Sending

   T.140 text is encoded and framed as T140blocks [RFC4103].

   Each T140block is sent on the SCTP stream [RFC4960] used to realize
   the T.140 data channel using standard T.140 transmission procedures
   [T140].  One or more T140blocks can be sent in a single SCTP user
   message [RFC4960].  Unlike RTP based transport for realtime text
   [RFC4103], T.140 data channels do not use reduntant transmission of
   text.

   Data sending and reporting procedures conform to [T140].

   See Section 8 of [T140] for coding details.

4.3.  Data Buffering

   As described in [T140], buffering can be used to reduce overhead,
   with the maximum buffering time being 500 ms.  It can also be used
   for staying within the maximum character transmission rate
   Section 3.2, if such has been provided by the peer.

5.  Gateway Considerations

   Multiple transport mechanisms have been defined for T.140 [T140], due
   to the long history and usage of the service in legacy packet-
   switched and circuit-switched networks.  Some examples are listed
   below:

   o  IP text telephony in text conversation mode [RFC4103]
   o  IP text telephony in text relay mode, also known as Text-over-IP
      (ToIP) [V151]
   o  IP text telephony in text pass-through mode, also known as
      Voiceband-over-IP (VBDoIP) [V152]
   o  PSTN text telephony

   In addition to simply moving text between two transport mechanisms, a
   gateway might have to perform procedures related to events like
   inactivity of T.140 traffic, RTP packets received out of order and
   loss of incoming RTP packets.

   The detailed gateway procedures for interworking between T.140 over
   data channel and other T.140 transport mechanisms are outside the
   scope of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   The generic security considerations for WebRTC data channels are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].  As data channels are
   always encrypted by design, the T.140 data channels will also be
   encrypted.

   The generic security considerations for the SDP-based external
   negotiation method are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

7.  IANA considerations

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace all instances of RFCXXXX with the
   RFC number of this document.]

   This document adds the subprotocol identifier "t140" to the
   "WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry" as follows:

                +--------------------------+-------------+
                | Subprotocol Identifier:  | t140        |
                | Subprotocol Common Name: | ITU-T T.140 |
                | Subprotocol Definition:  | RFCXXXX     |
                | Reference:               | RFCXXXX     |
                +--------------------------+-------------+
