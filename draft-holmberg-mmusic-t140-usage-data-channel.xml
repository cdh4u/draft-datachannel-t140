        This document specifies how a WebRTC data channel can be used as a
        transport mechanism for Real-time text using the ITU-T Protocol for multimedia
        application text conversation (Recommendation ITU-T T.140), and
        how the SDP offer/answer mechanism can be used to negotiate
        such data channel, referred to as T.140 data channel.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>
        The ITU-T Protocol for multimedia application text conversation (Recommendation ITU-T T.140)
        <xref target="T140"/> defines a protocol for text conversation, also known as
        real-time text. The native transport for IP networks is the "RTP Payload for Text Conversation"
        <xref target="RFC4103"/> mechanism, based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC4103"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document specifies how a WebRTC data channel <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel"/>
        can be used as a transport mechanism for T.140, and how the SDP offer/answer mechanism
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg"/> can be used to negotiate such data channel.
      </t>
      <t>      
        In this document, a T.140 data channel refers to a WebRTC data channel for which
        the instantiated sub-protocol is "t140", and where the channel is negotiated
        using the SDP-based external negotiation method <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE 1: This WebRTC term of a "T.140 data channel" is actually
        synonym to the originally introduced concept of a "T.140 data
        channel" for the T.140 protocol, see Section 4.3
        of <xref target="T140"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE 2: The decision to transport realtime text over a data channel,
        instead of using RTP based transport <xref target="RFC4103"/>, in WebRTC
        is constituted by use-case "U-C 5: Realtime text chat during an audio
        and/or video call with an individual or with multiple people in a conference",
        see Section 3.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The brief notation "T.140" is used as a synonym for the text
        conversation protocol according to <xref target="T140"/>.
      </t>

        This document is based on an earlier Internet draft edited by Keith Drage,

    <section anchor="sec.sdp" title="SDP Considerations">
      <t>
        The generic SDP considerations, including the SDP Offer/Answer proceudres, for
        negotiating a WebRTC data channel are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg"/>.
        This section defines the SDP considerations that are specific to a T.140 data channel.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec.sdp.dcmap" title="Use of dcmap Attribute">
        <t>
           An offerer and answerer MUST, in each offer and answer, include an SDP 'dcmap' 
           attribute <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg"/> in the SDP media
           descripton (m= section) <xref target="RFC4566"/> describing the SCTP association
           <xref target="RFC4960"/> used to realize the T.140 data channel.
        </t>
        <t>
          The offerer and answerer MUST include the subprotocol attribute parameter,
          with a "t140" parameter value, in the 'dcmap' attribute value.
        </t>
        <t>
          The offerer and answerer MAY include the priority attribute parameter and
          the label attribute parameter in the 'dcmap' attribute value. If the offerer
          includes a label attribute parameter, the answerer MUST NOT change the value
          in the answer.
        </t>
        <t>
          NOTE: As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel"/>,
          when a data channel is negotied using the mechanism defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol"/>,
          the label attribute parameter value has to be the same in both directions. That rule also
          applies also to data channels negotiated using the mechanism defined in this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          The offerer and answerer MUST NOT include the max-retr, max-time and ordered
          attribute parameters in the 'dcmap' attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
          Below is an example of the 'dcmap' attribute for an T.140
          data channel with stream=3 and without any label:
        </t>
        <t>
          a=dcmap:3 subprotocol="t140"
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec.sdp.dcsa" title="Use of dcsa Attribute">
        <t>
           An offerer and answerer MAY, in each offer and answer, include an
           SDP 'dcsa' attribute <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg"/>
           in the m= section describing the SCTP association used
           to realize the T.140 data channel.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec.sdp.dcsa.trans" title="Maximum Character Transmission">
          <t>
            A 'dcsa' attribute can contain the SDP 'fmtp' attribute used to indicate
            a maximum character transmission rate <xref target="RFC4103"/>. The 'cps'
            attribute parameter is used indicate the maximum character transmission rate
            that the endpoint that includes the attribute is able to receive. The 'format' attribute
            parameter is not used with T.140 data channels, and MUST be set to "-".
          </t>
          <t>
            If the 'fmtp' attribute is not included, it indicates that no maximum character transmission
            rate is indicated. It does not mean that the default value of 30 applies <xref target="RFC4103"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The offerer and answerer MAY modify the 'cps' attribute parameter value in subsequent
            offers and answers.
          </t>
          <t>
            NOTE: The 'cps' attribute parameter is especially useful when a T.140 data channel
            endpoint is acting as a gateway [<xref target="sec.gw"/>] and is interworking with
            a T.140 transport mechanism that have restrictions on how many characters can be sent
            per second.

        <section anchor="sec.sdp.dcsa.lan" title="Real-time Text Conversation Languages">
         <t>
            'dcsa' attributes can contain the SDP 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes
            <xref target="RFC8373"/> to negotiate the language to be used for the real-time
            text conversation.
        </t>
        <t>
            For a T.140 data channel, the modality is "written" <xref target="RFC8373"/>.

        <section anchor="sec.sdp.dcsa.dir" title="Real-time Text Direction">
          <t>
            'dcsa' attributes can contain the SDP 'sendonly', 'recvonly', 'sendrecv' and
            'inactive' attributes <xref target="RFC4566"/> to negotite the direction in 
            which text can be transmitted in a real-time text conversation, following
            the procedures in <xref target="RFC3264"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            NOTE: A WebRTC data channel is always bi-directional. The usage of the 'dcsa'
            attribute only affects the direction in which implementations are allowed to
            transmit text on a T.140 data channel.
          </t>
          <t>
            The offer/answer rules for the direction attributes are based on the rules 
            for unicast streams defined in <xref target="RFC3264"/>, as described below. 
            Note that the rules only apply to the direction attributes.
          </t>
          <t>
            NOTE: As for any other attribute included in a 'dcsa' attribute, the direction 
            attributes only apply to the T.140 data channel for which the 'dcsa' attribute
            is used. They have no impact on other data channels.
          </t>
          <t>
            Session level direction attributes <xref target="RFC4566"/> have no impact
            on a T.140 data channel. An offerer and answerer MUST mark the direction of
            the text by sending a direction attribute inside â€˜dcsa- attribute.

            Each T140block is sent on the SCTP stream <xref target="RFC4960"/> used to
            realize the T.140 data channel using standard T.140 transmission procedures
            <xref target="T140"/>. One or more T140blocks can be sent in a single
            SCTP user message <xref target="RFC4960"/>. Unlike RTP based transport for
            realtime text <xref target="RFC4103"/>, T.140 data channels do not use redundant
            transmission of text. The reason for this is that the T.140 data channel achieves
            robust transmission by using the "reliable" mode of the data channel.

            As described in <xref target="T140"/>, buffering can be used to reduce
            overhead, with the maximum buffering time being 500 ms. It can also be used for
            staying within the maximum character transmission rate (<xref target="sec.sdp.dcsa"/>),

            An implementation needs to take the user requirements for smooth flow and low

            It is RECOMMENDED to use the default transmission interval of 300 milliseconds

            retries are made to reestablish the T.140 data channels. If reestablishment of
            the T.140 data channel is successful, an implementation MUST evaluate if any

            the time of writing this document, this is true even in scenarios where each participant
            communicate via a centralized conference server. The reason is that, unlike RTP media,
            WebRTC data channels and the T.140 protocol do not support the indication of the source
            of T.140 data. The SDP 'dcmap' attribute label attribute parameter (<xref target="sec.sdp.dcmap"/>)
            can be used by the offerer to provide additional information about each T.140 data channel, and help

    <section anchor="sec.gw" title="Gateway Considerations">
      <t>
        A number of real-time text transports and protocols have been defined for
        both packet switched and circuit switched networks. Many are based on the 
        ITU-T T.140 protocol on application and presentation level <xref target="T140"/>. 
        At the time of writing this document, some mechanisms are no longer used, as
        the technologies they use have been obsoleted etc, while others are still in use.
      </t>
      <t>
        When performing interworking between T.140 data channels and another real-time text
        transports and protocols with real-time text in another, a number of factors 
        need to be considered.
        At the time of writing this document, the most common IP-based real-time text transport
        is the RTP based mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC4103"/>. While this document
        does not define a complete interworking solution, this list below provides some guidance
        and considerations to take into account when designing an gateway for interworking
        between T.140 data channels and RTP-based T.140 transport:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            For each T.140 data channel there is an RTP stream for real-time text <xref target="RFC4103"/> . 
            Redundancy is by default declared and used on RTP stream. On the T.140 data channel
            there is no redundancy, but the reliable property <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg"/>
            of T.140 the data channel is set.
          </t>
          <t>
            During a normal text flow, T140blocks received from one network are forwarded towards the other network.
            Keep-alive traffic is implicit on the T.140 data channel. A gateway might have to extract keep-alives from
            incoming RTP streams, and MAY generate keep-alives on outgoing RTP streams.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is RECOMMENDED that the gateway uses the same transmission interval on both the T.140 data channel and the RTP stream,
            if possible. That will reduce the delay caused by buffering.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the gateway detects or suspects loss of data on the RTP stream, the gateway gateway SHOULD insert the T.140 missing
            text marker <xref target="T140ad1"/> in the data sent on the outgoing T.140 data channel. 
          </t>
          <t>
            If the gateway detects or suspects loss of data on the T.140 data channel, the gateway gateway SHOULD insert the T.140 missing
            text marker <xref target="T140ad1"/> in the data sent on the outgoing RTP stream. 
          </t>
          <t>
            If the gateway detects that the T.140 data channel has failed and got torn down, once the data channel has been reestablished
            the gateway SHOULD insert the T.140 missing text marker <xref target="T140ad1"/> in the data sent on the outgoing RTP stream
            if it detects or suspects that data on the T.140 data channel was lost.
          </t>
          <t>
            The gateway MUST indicate the same text transmission direction (<xref target="sec.sdp.dcsa.dir"/>) on the T.140 data channel
            and the RTP stream.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: In order for the gateway to insert a missing text marker, or to perform other actions that require that the
        gateway has access to the T.140 data, the T.140 data cannot be encrypted end-to-end between the T.140 data channel endpoint
        and the RTP endpoint. At the time of writing this document, a mechanism to provide such end-to-end encryption has not been defined.
